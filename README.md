# MMM-SimplePlayer

This magic mirror module will enable the user to play music, control playback through a mouse or touchscreen and view details of the Track playing. 

Tracks are cane be played from either:
 	a local folder relative to the MagicMirror folder
 	a named playlist in a local folder, containing local tracks in folders relative to the requested musicDirectory, and/or from any streaming servers
 	a DLNA server visible to the magicMirror

## Tracks

### Formats

As this module uses the HTML5 Audio tag supported in most modern browsers and Electron (the native Magimirror GUI) then only tracks of these types are supported: MP3, OGG, WAV. 

If tracks are in different formats, such as WMA, then use a conversion tool to create MP3 versions. VLC is a great free player that will also convert tracks from various formats to MP3.

### Security and track location

Modern browsers incorporate various security features that wont load tracks from "unSafe" locations. Different browsers (inclduing Electron) have different interpretations of what is "unSafe" and so tracks in a location playable from one device/interface may be rejected in another combination. 

Some browsers will not Autoplay tracks when MM is first started. In this case, to play the first track, press play. After that, track changes will play automatically

If the tracks are on the MagicMirror server, then store them in a folder that is relative to the musicDirectory folderpath. The default location is in a music folder within the MMM-SimplePlayer folder within the modules folder of the MagicMirror implementation.

If using a playlist, then the tracks within the playlist should either refer to the same or similar folder within the MagicMirror folder structure and/or be streamed from a web server. DLNA servers make a good source as they can be anywhere on your network. 

### Playlist formats

Playlists in the standard m3u or m3u8 format are supported. For local tracks make sure that the track is referenced in a relative way (i.e. it shouldnt start with \ or /) and that is is within the folder or a subfolder of musicDirectory config entry, see examples below.

If the tracks are from a webserver, then they should start with HTTP:// or HTTPS://

There are many tools available to build a standard playlist. Microsofts Legacy Media player (MMP) can easily add tracks from a DLNA server into a playlist, that can then be saved in m3u format.

### Example Playlist - from DLNA server, created using MMP

```

### Example Playlist - using local files

```
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:0
track1.mp3
#EXTINF:0
track2.mp3
#EXTINF:0
track3.mp3
```

Note that in this example these tracks are in the folder indicated in the musicDirectory config value

## Module Installation and config options

### Dependencies

This module requires music-metadata if meta data is to be displayed.

### Installation
To install the module, use your terminal to:
1. Navigate to your MagicMirror's modules folder. If you are using the default installation directory, use the command:<br />`cd ~/MagicMirror/modules`
2. Clone the module:<br />`git clone https://github.com/TheBodger/MMM-SimplePlayer`
3. cd to the folder:<br />`cd MMM-SimplePlayer`
4. Install dependencies:<br />`npm install`

### Update
to update this module, use your terminal to:
1. `cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-SimplePlayer`
2. `git pull`

### MagicMirrorÂ² Configuration

To use this module, add the following minimum configuration block to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
```js
		{
			module: "MMM-SimplePlayer",
			position: "top_left",
		},
```
This will show the Simple format of controls (as in example 1 above) which will play any valid tracks from the folder MMM-SimplePlayer/music

### Example Config

```js
{
	module: "MMM-SimplePlayer",
	position: "top_left",
	config: {
		autoplay: true, 
		playTracks: false, //Means eithe play from the directory or not, must be false to use the playlist
		musicDirectory: "modules/MMM-SimplePlayer/music",
		usePlaylist: true,
		playlistName: "examplePlaylist.m3u",
		showEvents: false,
		showMeta: true,
		startMuted: false,
	}
},
```

## Comments

The module may fail if an invalid file or folder location is included. If the behaviour isnt as expected, check that folders and files are always within a folder path that includes the musicDirectory value. If this doesnt resolve the problem, raise an error report with a copy of the config used, and details of the where the music is, and how the MagicMirror is run and on what OS/platform.

Additional capabilities may be added, including showing Album Images and alternative controls layout.
