# MMM-SimplePlayer

This magic mirror module will enable the user to play music, control playback and view details of the Track playing. Tracks are either played from a local folder relative to the MagicMirror folder or from a named playlist in a local folder, containing locals tracks in folders relative to the MagicMirror Folder, or from any streaming servers.

## Tracks

###Formats

As this module uses the HTML5 Audio tag supported in most modern browsers and Electron (the native Magimirror GUI) then only tracks of these types are supported: MP3, OGG, WAV. 

If tracks are in different formats, such as WMA, then use a conversion tool to create MP3 versions. VLC is a great free player that will also convert tracks from various formats to MP3.

###Security and track location

Modern browsers incorporate various security features that wont load tracks from "unSafe" locations. Different browsers (inclduing Electron) have different interpretations of what is "unSafe" and so tracks in a location playable from one device/interface may be rejected in another combination. 

If the tracks are on the MagicMirror server, then store them in a folder that is relative to the Main MagicMirror folder (this is the location that MagicMirror is run from). The default location is in a music folder within the MMM-SimplePlayer folder within the modules folder of the MagicMirror implementation.

If using a playlist, then the tracks within the playlist shoudl either refer to the same or similar folder within the MagicMirror folder structure and/or be streamed from a web server. DLNA servers make a good source as they can be anywhere on your network. 

###Playlist formats

Playlists in the standard m3u or m3u8 format are supported. For local tracks make sure that the track is referenced in a relative way (i.e. it shouldnt start with \ or /) and that is is within or the folder or subfolder indicated by the folders in the musicDirectory config entry, see examples below.

If the tracks are from a webserver, then they should start with HTTP:// or HTTPS://

There are many tools available to build a standard playlist. Microsofts Legacy Media player (MMP) can easily add tracks from a DLNA server into a playlist, that can then be saved in m3u format.

###Example Playlist - from DLNA server, created using MMP
